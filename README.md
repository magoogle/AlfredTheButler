# Alfred the butler
#### V1.7.9
## DISCLAIMER
Alfred is a plugin that CAN read and write files. In this repo, I have specifically only write to data/export folder and only read from data/import folder. It will ONLY read and write files if you press the import/export function on the menu. This is an open-source repo and you are free to check the code on what files alfred will read/write.

Alfred also does near-instant sell and near-instant salvage, it will likely sell/salvage before you even see the inventory page open. It will still obey your filter settings (both GA count and affix/unique/mythic filters)

## Description
Alfred is your personal butler in Skov_Temis. He is capable of stashing, salvaging and selling items based on your settings. He is also capable of restock boss summon materials as well as infernal horde compasses. Additionally, he will also display status of your inventory on top left of your screen and you can see how many items alfred will stash/keep, salvage or sell as well as count/max boss summon materials and infernal horde compasses that you instruct alfred to restock.

there are 4 trigger conditions that can get alfred to do tasks:
- called by an external plugin
- inventory (or obol) is full and you went back to Skov_Temis
- a manual trigger via keybind
- restock mode is set to active and you have less than the hardcoded minimum (for boss item, it is set to the minimum required to summon boss, for compass it is 1)

For aspect/unique/mythic/affix filters, if you are using a build guide from mobalytics, here is a tool made by RadicalDadical55 that can create a proper import json for you to use: https://github.com/RadDude42/Build-Scraper

## For devs
Alfred exposes an external collection of functions via global variable `PLUGIN_alfred_the_butler`.
Also in the task folder, there is an `external-template.lua` as a sample on how to call alfred from other plugins.

## Known issues
- some aspects are giving false positive, mainly those that have multiple data (e.g. frost stride). for now, alfred is treating them as real max aspect to not accidentally sell/salvage a max one
